# Spirus

HTML5 Electron Typescript Canvas framework thing, scrapped off one of my games called Yushite.

Includes OOTB:

- The base framework
- A mouse-collision detection hello world project

## How to use?

Download with degit

```bash
eclipse@root $: npx degit spirusdev/template spirus-project
eclipse@root $: cd spirus-project
```

## Get started

Install dependencies

```bash
eclipse@root $: npm install
```

Now develop real-time with

```bash
eclipse@root $: npm run dev
```

You should get an electron window pop up, if so then good job.

## Compilation

If you wish to compile, run this command

```bash
eclipse@root $: npm run build
```

After that, go into `/dist` and *voila*! Your newly prepared `index.html`, `index.css` and `index.js` are ready
